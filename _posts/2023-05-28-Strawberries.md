The sun shines through the window,
A gentle breeze wafts through the air.
It's a perfect Sunday morning.

I sit down at the table,
A bowl of strawberries in front of me.
I take a bite, and the sweetness explodes in my mouth.

The strawberries are so juicy,
And the flavor is so fresh.
I close my eyes and savor the moment.

I eat strawberry after strawberry,
Until the bowl is empty.
I feel happy and content.

I stand up and stretch,
Ready to start the day.
I know that it will be a good day,
Because I started it with strawberries.
